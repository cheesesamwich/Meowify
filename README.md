## Installation

### For now there are no builds, so you have to run the software directly from your terminal

Install `pnpm`:

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

Clone the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cheesesamwich/Meowify
cd Meowify
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Start Meowify:
```shell
pnpm start
```
⚠️ Make sure this is ran in the root directory (pro tip: the one with the package.json file)
